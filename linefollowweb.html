        </div>
        <p>A line follower robot is a robot that autonomously follows a path drawn on the floor. The robot uses IR sensors to sense the surface, and optical sensing arrays to move precisely on the line.</p>
        <!-- <p>Line follower robots are used in semi to fully autonomous plants to transport materials from one manufacturing point to another. They can also inspect products and detect flaws, which can help in quality control and increase efficiency.</p> -->
        <p>Line follower robots can use a black line on a white surface, or a white line on a black surface.
